Contents

    Create a node.js Express project containing:
        eslint setup
        package.json
        readme.md
        nodemon for running the dev environment (use local npm package and start with npm script)
        git repo: include .gitignore and set a remote repo in Github, create and checkout a new branch git checkout -b week1
    Implement a (dummy) REST API including following resources/endpoints:
        read some data from server (send response in json format)
        send some data to server
        delete data (just a dummy functionality, test error response too)
        modify something (just a dummy functionality, test error response too)
        send 404 response for non-existing resources
    Adapt HTTP standards:
        use appropriate HTTP methods for requests
        set correct status codes and Content-Type headers to responses
    Test with Postman or similar
    Commit your changes (git add . & git commit -m "describe you changes here") and push your week1 branch to the remote repo in Github (git push -u origin week1)
    Extra: Add more funtionalities to your REST API
