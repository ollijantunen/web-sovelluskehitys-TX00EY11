Week assignment 1 - Getting started with node.js

##### Contents

- [x] eslint setup
- [x] package.json
- [x] readme.md
- [x] nodemon for running the dev environment (use local npm package and start with npm script)

_.gitignore on projektin juuressa_ https://github.com/ollijantunen/web-sovelluskehitys-TX00EY11/blob/week1/.gitignore

##### Implement a (dummy) REST API including following resources/endpoints:
- [x] read some data from server (send response in json format)
- [x] send some data to server
- [ ] delete data (just a dummy functionality, test error response too)
- [ ] modify something (just a dummy functionality, test error response too)
- [x] send 404 response for non-existing resources

##### Adapt HTTP standards:
- [ ] use appropriate HTTP methods for requests
- [ ] set correct status codes and Content-Type headers to responses

##### Test
- [ ] Test with Postman or similar

- [x] Commit your changes (git add . & git commit -m "describe you changes here") and push your week1 branch to the remote repo in Github (git push -u origin week1)

Extra: Add more funtionalities to your REST API
